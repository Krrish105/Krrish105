# Hello ðŸ‘‹

Greetings! Thank you for checking out my profile. I have always been fascinated by Computer Science since I was a child. A few years ago, I realized that my passion for programming and problem-solving could become a fulfilling career. However, I soon learned that there is much more to learn in this field beyond what is taught in school.

I started learning to program when I was ten years old, thanks to the school curriculum that introduced me to the Logo programming language. But at that time, I had not yet decided what specific area of programming I wanted to pursue. Later, during the Covid pandemic, I stumbled upon the FreeCodeCamp website while homeschooling due to personal issues, and that is when my actual learning journey began. I got deeply involved in learning Web Development.

I am a naturally curious person and enjoy reading books on various topics. Feel free to connect with me if you want to chat about tech, books or anything.
