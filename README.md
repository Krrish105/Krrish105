# Hello 👋

Heyy 🙋🏻‍♀️, Thank you for visiting my profile! Continue reading to know more about my journey✨. 

Since childhood, the subject of Computer Science has always fascinated me. A few years back I realized that my passion for programming and solving problems could be transformed into a full-time career, so I started pursuing it. But at that time, I didn’t realize that there are so many things to learn in this field other than what is taught in school. 

Technically, I started to learn to program when I was 10 years old (the programming language I first learned was Logo) because of the school curriculum, but at that time I didn’t know what I wanted to specifically pursue in the programming field, therefore, in Covid, when I had to opt for homeschooling due to personal issues, I stumbled upon the FreeCodeCamp Website, and since then, my actual learning started and I got immersed in learning Web Development. 

Currently, I am learning Full Stack Development.

Looking for freelance work/remote job or internship.

I am a curious person and an avid reader. Feel free to connect with me to talk about tech, books, etc. 🤝🏻
